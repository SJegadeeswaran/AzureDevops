This project is forked from: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-java
This is just a sample java project for building the war files and then build a docker image from it. 
The docker image is then pushed to container registry and deployed using AKS cluster.
All these are done using Azure devops service (As of July 2022) .
